15. 15. How does the clock skew and clock jitter affect the setup conditions and hold conditions? 
In the presence of clock skew and clock jitter, the RAT and AT for setup and hold conditions will change.  
For Setup condition: 
Arrival time = tcq + tcomb 
Required Arrival time = Tclk + tskew - tsu – 2tjitter 
For Hold condition: 
Arrival time = Tclk + tcq + tcomb 
Required Arrival time = Tclk + tskew + thold + 2tjitter 




16. what happen if setup slack or hold slack is zero, would it still be a violation or not ?
“If setup or hold slack is zero, it’s not considered a violation, because timing just meets the required limits.
But in practice, a design with 0 slack has no margin, so any small variation could cause a failure.
That’s why engineers aim for positive slack to ensure robust timing closure.”
