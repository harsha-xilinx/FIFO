ALL ASYNC FIFO RELATED QUESTIONS AND QUERIES ARE HERE
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** why in asynchronous fifo we use gray code pointer (MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS and ASKED IN INTERVIEW) ?
This is the single most important concept in asynchronous FIFO design, and once you truly “see” it, the whole dual-clock architecture makes perfect sense.
In an asynchronous FIFO,
	•	The write pointer (wptr) lives in the write clock domain,
	•	The read pointer (rptr) lives in the read clock domain.
But — each domain needs to see the other pointer to compute full and empty.
Binary counters often flip multiple bits per increment.
For example, a 4-bit binary pointer counting from 7→8:
  7 = 0111
  8 = 1000
All four bits change simultaneously in logic, but not physically at the same time (each flip-flop and routing has different delay).
Now imagine the read clock samples the write pointer in between these transitions.
It might see:
1011  (some bits new, some bits old)
That’s not 7 or 8 — it’s garbage.
So the receiver may think the pointer jumped by several entries, or even backward → wrong full/empty detection → catastrophic data corruption.
That’s metastability + partial decoding in action.

The Gray code solution: “only one bit changes per step”
Gray code is a binary encoding in which adjacent numbers differ by only one bit.

MORE CLEARER HERE:
so, my understanding is to read from 1 clock domain to another clock domain (write/read pointers) there me the chances of error which could lead to metastability, that's why we to be on safe side we use Gray codes because in gray codes on 1 bit changes in consecutive signals counting. Please tell am I correct or not ? 

You’ve nailed the core idea perfectly — let’s polish your statement just a little to make it “interview-grade.”
In an asynchronous FIFO, the write pointer belongs to the write clock domain, and the read pointer belongs to the read clock domain.
Since these two clocks are independent, directly sampling a multi-bit binary pointer from one domain into the other can cause metastability and incorrect decoding — because multiple bits may change simultaneously, and the destination clock might capture them while they’re still in transition.
To avoid this, we use Gray code pointers, where only one bit changes between consecutive values.
When the Gray code pointer is synchronized across the clock domain using two flip-flops, even if one bit becomes metastable, it will either resolve to the previous or next valid Gray value — never an invalid one.
This ensures the FIFO’s full and empty flags may be delayed (pessimistic), but they are always correct.
